THIS IS NOT YET READY FOR USE.


This is a small python script for downloading Reddit videos and gifs.

Just run the main.py file and follow the instructions. Maybe I will make a gui later on.

All the main functions for getting the source of the video and actually saving it are in the functions.py file.

This was made on windows.
